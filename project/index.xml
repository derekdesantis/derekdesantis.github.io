      <description>There are many factors that determine how we perceive and ultimately classify the climate into distinct regions, or biomes. For example, precipitation, temperature, flora and fauna are key ingredients in our delineation of biomes. Classifying biomes is akin to understanding the homogeneity of climate and resources on a local scale. It is not only important that we can classify climate biomes, but also their evolution with the changing climate. For emphasis, it is not possible to perform any meaningful environmental preservation without predetermined knowledge of what the environment is at a coarse scale.</description>

      <description>For a Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$, $y \in \mathscr{H}$ and $T \in \mathscr{B}(\mathscr{H})$, the equation \begin{equation} T x = y \end{equation} has a solution whenever $T$ is left invertible. For any left inverse $L$ of $T$, $x = L y$ is a solution. More generally, if $T$ has closed range, $T$ has a pseudo left inverse. Concretely, if $T \in \mathscr{B}(\mathscr{H})$ has closed range, restricting to $\ker(T)^\perp$ we obtain a new operator that is left invertible.</description>

      <title>Theory of Tensor Factorizations</title>

      <description>Data measured from a high-order complex system can be difficult to analyze. A convenient tool to store such data is in the form of a tensor, or d-way array. Each entry of the array describes the value obtained across the d independent parameters. Often, the dependencies between the indices is not clear, making interpretation of the data a demanding task.
Most naturally occurring datasets are formed by directly observing and measuring quantities.</description>
