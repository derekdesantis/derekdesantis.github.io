Tensor factorization can extract latent features and perform dimension reduction that can facilitate discoveries of new mechanisms hidden in the data. The nonnegative tensor factorization extracts latent features that are naturally sparse and are parts of the data, which makes them easily interpretable. This easy interpretability places the nonnegative factorization as a uniquely suitable method for exploratory data analysis and unsupervised learning. The standard Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) algorithm for tensor factorization experiences difficulties when applied to tensors with rank deficient factors. For example, the rank deficiency, or linear dependence in the factors, cannot be easily reproduced by the standard PARAFAC because the presence of noise in the real-world data can force the algorithm to extract linearly independent factors. Methods for low-rank approximation and extraction of latent features in the rank deficient case, such as PARALIND family of models, have been successfully developed for general tensors. In this paper, we propose a similar approach for factorization of nonnegative tensors with rank deficiency. Firstly, we determine the minimal nonnegative cones containing the initial tensor and by using a nonnegative Tucker decomposition determine its nonnegative multirank. Secondly, by a nonnegative Tucker decomposition we derived the core tensor and factor matrices corresponding to this multirank. Thirdly, we apply a nonnegative CPD to the derived core tensor to avoid the problematic rank deficiency. Finally, we combine both factorizations to obtain the final CPD factors and demonstrate our approach in several synthetic and real-world examples.","tags":["Tensor Factorizations"],"title":"Nonnegative Canonical Polyadic Decomposition with Rank Deficient Factors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Derek DeSantis"],"categories":null,"content":"Operator algebras generated by partial isometries and their adjoints form the basis for some of the most well studied classes of C*-algebras.

For example, precipitation, temperature, flora and fauna are key ingredients in our delineation of biomes. Classifying biomes is akin to understanding the homogeneity of climate and resources on a local scale. It is not only important that we can classify climate biomes, but also their evolution with the changing climate. For emphasis, it is not possible to perform any meaningful environmental preservation without predetermined knowledge of what the environment is at a coarse scale.\nHistorically, the standard used to classify climate biomes has been the Köppen-Geiger (KG) model [1]. The KG model is an expert based judgment that describes climate zones based off of temperature and precipitation measurements. The model utilizes a fixed decision tree, where each branch uses various information about temperature and precipitation. This heuristic allows one to broadly assess climate regions. While KG is interpretable, it is overly simplistic and somewhat arbitrary.\nA solution to this problem is to move towards data-driven methods of classification. Various authors have noted this, and have applied unsupervised models to classify the climate (see for example, [2], [3]). These data driven approaches to climate clustering are an epistemological improvement over the use chosen heuristics of KG. However, they still suffer from two key problems. First, the algorithms themselves are user chosen, and therefore somewhat arbitrary themselves. There is no external measurement to measure how much one trusts the clustering result. Second, because the algorithms are dependent on the input data, they are dependent on the scale at which the data is acquired. A priori, it is not clear how this \u0026ldquo;hidden parameter\u0026rdquo; of scale affects the overall clustering result. The goal of this project is to address both of these problems.\n[1] Markus Kottek, Jürgen Grieser, Christoph Beck, Bruno Rudolf, and Franz Rubel.

For any left inverse $L$ of $T$, $x = L y$ is a solution. More generally, if $T$ has closed range, $T$ has a pseudo left inverse. Concretely, if $T \\in \\mathscr{B}(\\mathscr{H})$ has closed range, restricting to $\\ker(T)^\\perp$ we obtain a new operator that is left invertible. Picking a left inverse $L$ for $T\\mid_{\\ker(T)^\\perp}$, we find that $x = L y$ is a solution.\nIn most applications, there is a canonical choice for the left inverse $L$. Generally, this is the Moore-Penrose inverse, denoted $T^\\dagger$. It is the unique left inverse such that $\\ker(T^\\dagger) = \\mbox{ran}(T)^\\perp$. To construct $T^\\dagger$, one considers $T$ mapping $\\ker(T)^\\perp$ to $\\mbox{ran}(T)$. From this perspective, $T$ is bijective, and thus boundedly invertible by the open mapping theorem. The unique inverse, once extended by zero, is $T^\\dagger$. For instance, if $T$ is an isometry then $T^\\dagger = T^*$, the adjoint of $T$.\nOne subject where closed range operators are frequently used is frame theory. A sequence {$f_n$} in a Hilbert space $\\mathscr{H}$ is said to be a frame if there exists constants $0\u0026lt; A \\leq B$ such that \\begin{equation} A ||x||^2 \\leq \\sum_n | \\langle x, f_n \\rangle |^2 \\leq B ||x||^2 \\end{equation} for all $x \\in \\mathscr{H}$.\nAssociated to each Hilbert space frame {$f_n$} is a (canonical) dual frame {$g_n$}. Using this dual frame, one can reconstruct elements $f$ of the Hilbert space $\\mathscr{H}$ in an analogous way to orthonormal basis:\n\\begin{equation} f = \\sum_{n \\geq 1} \\langle f, g_n \\rangle f_n \\end{equation}\nIt is easy to see that orthonormal bases are frames, but not all frames need be orthogonal, norm one, or even contain a unique set of elements. A frame does not enforce the rigidity of inner products that an orthonormal basis does - allowing for variation between individual frame elements (rather than just 0 or 1). The flexibility of the definition has engendered applications across signal processing and harmonic analysis. For instance, frames may be constructed for particular features of a problem that are precluded from orthogonal bases due to their requirement for linear independence. Further, this extra redundancy helps to protect signals from degradation, ensuring that the effects of erasures are minimized. The looseness of the structure allows one to construct the analog of frames for structures that don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily come equipped with suitable generalization of an orthonormal basis. Indeed, certain classes of Hilbert C*-Modules and Banach spaces posses frames.\nMany questions concerning Hilbert space frames are inexorably tied to questions of closed ranged and left invertible operators. All frames for closed subspaces of a Hilbert $\\mathscr{H}$ spaces arise as the application of a closed range operator $T$ on a frame for $\\mathscr{H}$. Properties of frames, such as rigidity and perturbation results also depend on the analysis of closed range operators. With this groundwork of closed ranged operators and frame theory laid, we now describe our interest in generating concrete operator algebras.\nA well-studied class of operator algebras are C-algebras generated by partial isometries. For example graph algebras, C-algebras generated partial isometries subject to constraints of a directed graph, reside here.\nRepresentations of graph C*-algebras arising from a directed graph may be described as follows. Given a directed graph, choose a Hilbert space for each vertex of the graph (with suitable dimension depending on loops of the graph). After direct summing each of these spaces together, we obtain a Hilbert space $\\mathscr{H}$ where each vertex corresponds to an orthogonal summand of $\\mathscr{H}$. By choosing orthonormal sequences for each of these closed, orthogonal subspaces of $\\mathscr{H}$, we then pick partial isometries that map one summand to another, subject to the Cuntz-Krieger relations.\nThe partial isometric generators of concrete graph algebras preserve orthonormal basis (that is, up to the kernels of the partial isometries). The representation of the graph C-algebra can be viewed as encoding the dynamics of walks on the graph. A natural extension of these concrete graph C-algebras is one that encodes the dynamics of a frame.\nOne arrives at a such an extension by replacing partial isometries and their adjoints with closed ranged operators and their Moore-Penrose inverses. As discussed above, the closed range operators preserve frame theoretic quantities. In the isometric case, the Moore-Penrose inverse is the adjoint. Hence, such operator algebras reduce to the C-algebraic case when the generators are isometric. Therefore, this class of operator algebras is the natural generalization of concrete graph C-algebras that integrates frame theory. This leads us to the following general program:\nGiven a set of operators with closed range and their Moore-Penrose inverses construct the norm-closed algebra subject to the constraints of a directed graph.

Analyzing Earth system model (ESM) data, such as that from the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM), is further complicated due to the complex interactions between different components of the Earth’s system model. Indeed, most of climate science focuses on single component analysis, e.g. ocean or sea ice. At present, ESMs are constructed to understand average statistics, such as total conservation of heat and moisture. However, sophisticated dynamics such as heat and moisture transport in coupled system simulations remains elusive. Discovering sophisticated latent climatic signals in fully coupled E3SM data is a challenging task for a number of reasons. Principal among them, we currently do not fully understand the latent signatures within each component, or how these signals will be amplified when information is shared between components.\nIn this project, we developed an interpretable unsupervised machine learning technique for diagnostics of the E3SM MPAS-O model. Here, we have temperature and salinity data round The Southern Ocean. Depending on the length of the simulation, one can incur model discrepancies. Ideally we would like to automatically identify physically relevant instabilities within the model. Pinpointing how key water masses evolve with time can help provide these insights. We preform an unsupervised clustering technique to separate the data into classes (Gaussian mixture model). We then analyze where these classes reside by depth. By looking at key overlapping depth regions, one can interpret the vertical mixing and identify which clusters belongs to the important water masses. Comparing the water masses across two time periods provides insight into how the model has drifted over time.
